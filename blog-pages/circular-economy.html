    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Upcycling is the practice of adding value to an unwanted item to create a new product out of waste. Rather than recycling, which focuses on breaking down products, upcycling uplifts and gives new life to materials, allowing for them to be reused rather than discarded. </p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;As the planet continues to suffer under the strain of over-consumption that causes mass pollution and environmental disruption, upcycling is an important and creative part of living more sustainable lives.  </p>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There are significant environmental costs to attaining the raw materials needed to create consumer goods, including deforestation and mining, which shifts and alters natural landscapes. By upcycling, you create a closed-loop where you reuse goods rather than buying new items that drive the demand for new raw materials.
      </li>
      <li>
        Manufacturing, packaging, and shipping all require significant greenhouse gas emissions. By reusing rather than consuming, upcycling reduces our emissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upcycling also significantly reduces waste that would otherwise overflow landfills and pollute our environment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Upcycling’s Importance in a Circular Economy</h3>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;A circular economy focuses on reusing goods and keeping resources in the economy as long as possible in order to reduce the amount of virgin materials needed to be created. This system differs from current economic models centered around a linear economy that instead is centered around manufacturing, consumption, and then subsequent disposal, with little steps to ensure that materials are reused. Upcycling is an important tool in a circular economy, allowing for a closed-loop where materials are upgraded into new creations rather than discarded, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of consumption of natural resources on the environment.</p>
    <h3>Pollution</h3>
